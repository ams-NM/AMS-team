- ## Plan
	- ### [[RWY34]]
		- Path: [[LT31]] Rx -> [[LT31]] Tx -> [[FD12P]] -> [[MAWS]]
			- [[MAWS]] power and signal cables need re-connect.
			- All these sets of sensors' signals are joined in [[Termbox]] on [[LT31]] Rx in one cable, before connect to [[MOXA]]s in [[GP]] room.
		- Disconnect original power and signal cables of [[MAWS]]
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Disconnect [[FD12P]] signal wires to [[MOXA]] in [[GP]] room.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Withdraw  those cables from [[LT31]] transmitter [[Junction Box]] in the ground.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Put the cables on the ground and re-connect them to resume service.
