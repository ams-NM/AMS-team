			- We did not noticed at the moment that the software did not act normally at that moment.
			- We stopped the active one and wait for this standby one to turn active. But nothing happened after about 4 minutes.
			- So we exited the software and rebooted the PC.
			- After that, we started the software and it took over active after about 2 minutes.
			- #lesson Verify the standby ATIS works normally before doing a changeover.
