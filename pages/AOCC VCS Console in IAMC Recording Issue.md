- ## Ideas
	- ### Options 1 : Just use the former console port ==No.12==
		- TODO It's the easiest way, but problems?
		-
	- ### Options 2: Find out how to connect new port ==No. 8== to Recording System.
		- There are huge amount of connection wires from [[VCS]] core switch to the nearby [[MDF]].
		- It's really hard to find out where and how they were connected for console recording.

- ## Logs
	- [[AOCC]] [[VCS Console]] was located in the room at ATC level 1. Then they asked to move over to [[IAMC]].
	- During the transition, we used a spare [[Console]] port(==No. 8==, was `No.12`) in [[VCS]] `Core Switch`.
	- ### [[2024-09-26 Thu]]
		- We haven't found connection of port No.8 to the  `Recording System`.
