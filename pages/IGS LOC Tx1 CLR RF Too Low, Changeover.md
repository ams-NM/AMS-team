## [[2025-01-08 Wed]] [[LPA]] module defective
	- [[2025-01-14 Tue]]
		- <mark class='green'>Problem solved</mark> : just turn off [[LOC]], and switch off the power. Restart again and warning was gone.
	- [[2025-01-08 Wed]]
	- A <mark class='red'>Standby-Warning</mark> was activated.
	- Check error log, found that Tx1 CLR RF too low.
	- Replaced a spare [[LPA]] on Tx1 CLR,
	- `Temperature: -60Â°C` warning, and 'Integrity Failure' shows on equipment display
	- ### And the 'Current' & 'Voltage' readings on PS SMP 700 was incorrect.
		- We've replaced it with a spare SMP 600, but found not DC output.
		- So just reinstalled the original SMP 700.
